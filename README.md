## Description
Da Best In Chi is a foodie post and review website, where users can add/post/review Chicago restaurants they think are the best in the Chi-town food scene.  Users can add a restaurant, upload photos for a meal post, and comment about the food or the restaurant itself (including the restaurant seating)!  Think Yelp or Google with an exception of a space thats built around the food and its establishment vs. a review.  The idea here is for users to be able to shout out their fave-food-spots in Chicago while keeping a positive focus on each restaurant.  Even if every foodies experience isn't 100, I am sure everyone may be able to agree there maybe something on the restaurant's menu that is worth posting about.

Created by three of us - one from Autin, one from Florida, and one Chi-city native - this project was not as easy as eating as we thought it would be.  From three creative minds with ideas to one github account for this project, lets not forget the many to many model - it was definitely a learning experience.  And with that, we managed to find a nice Chicago background for the site that incorporates the flag and its neighborhoods. Whether a local or just visiting, everyone can attest the Chicago food scene is a vibe and a must-try Chicago staple!  So Da Best In Chi welcomes all foodies, food connoisseurs, locals looking for a new place to try, and those just trying to get some grub - as (hopefully) their go-to for anything and everything Chicago food!
